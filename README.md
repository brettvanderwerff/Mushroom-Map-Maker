# Mushroom-Map-Maker
This program generates a heat map of a specific mushroom's distribution across the globe.

The program uses the gmplot package and GPS data of mushroom observations from mushroomobserver.org.

Installation:

Download the complete repo, install the dependencies, then launch either mushroom_map_maker_web_app.py (recommended) or mushroom_map_maker.py

Dependencies:

Flask_WTF==0.14.2,
WTForms==2.1,
Flask==0.12.2,
setuptools==28.8.0,
Flask_Bootstrap==3.3.7.1,
requests==2.18.4,

Note: gmplot is not a dependency, so do not pip install it as a package before running. gmplot was included directly in the repo because the source code has been (roughly) modifed to communicate with flask. mushroom_map_maker.py can be run directly or can be run through the flask app mushroom_map_maker_web_app. The program was designed primarly for use through the flask app. 

An example of the output generated by a search for a mushroom with the genus amanita and the species muscaria:

In the app, this map can be scrolled to see the distribution of amanita muscaria across the globe.
